To test out, run:

```
go run main.go puc19.gbk
```

### TODO
This is not usable currently. To implement:
1. Ability to select sequence (vim-like)
2. Proper color high-lighting (and sane defaults)
3. Good information viewing for feature list (maybe change to grid)

After these, the plan is:
1. Implement ability to change sequence
2. Feature addition and import
3. io.Writer and stream implementation (to scroll through genomes)
4. Find capability
