To test out, run:

```
go run main.go puc19.gbk
```

### TODO
This is not usable currently. To implement:
1. Ability to select sequence (vim-like)
2. Proper color high-lighting (and sane defaults)

### Hotkeys
```
escape: switch to default view
a: switch to action view
s: switch to sequence view
  i: switch to editable sequence view (insert)
  v: switch to highlight sequence view
f: switch to feature view

h: left
j: down
k: up
l: right
```
